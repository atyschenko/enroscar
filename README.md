Enroscar
=======

**A set of Android tools that facilitate apps development**

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/stanfy/enroscar.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/stanfy/enroscar)

Well, this repo contains pretty much code, smelling in some parts.
But the general idea is that there are several independent modules. Each of them contains
a tool with a specific purpose. These modules can be smoothly integrated using the `assist` module.

**Definitely worth to check out now:**
* [Goro](goro) - a generic tool for organizing asynchronous tasks in queues and Android service
* [Enroscar Async](async) - a library that helps to put any asynchronous operation behind Android Loader and
  integrate it with [RxJava](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava).
