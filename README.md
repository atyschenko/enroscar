Enroscar
=======

**A set of Android tools that facilitate apps development**

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/stanfy/enroscar.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/stanfy/enroscar)

Well, this repo contains pretty much code, smelling in some parts.
But the general idea is that there are several independent modules. Each of them contains
a tool with a specific purpose. These modules can be smoothly integrated using the `assist` module.

**Definitely worth to check out now:**
* [Goro](goro) - a generic tool for organizing asynchronous tasks in queues and Android service
* [Enroscar IO](io) - a buffers pool implementation along with some other i/o utilities

In our continuous dev stack:
* [Enroscar Net](net) - do more with `URLConnection` class
* content
* images
* ui
* stats
* beans
* assist

[Old "docs" are relocated](README_OLD.md)
and will be present there not for a very long time, we hope.
